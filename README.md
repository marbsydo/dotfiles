![Yes, I did have to install a utility specifically for taking the screenshot](https://github.com/marbsydo/dotfiles/blob/master/2016-02-22-232835_1920x1080_scrot.png)

This is the configuration of my laptop, which uses the **[i3 tiling window manager](https://i3wm.org/)** on **[Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)**.

## Dependencies

* `i3` for the window management.
* `feh` for setting the wallpaper.
* `ttf-font-awesome` (AUR) for the i3bar icons.
* `pulseaudio` for audio.
* ...others, which will be appended in due course.

## Colour scheme

The colour scheme is **[Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)**, applied to the terminal, i3bar and vim.
